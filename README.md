# College
This project is about the most important codes I've implemented at 
college. I am trying to improve it by organizing everything as better as 
I can now. I didn't submit all my codes, because then it'd be really 
unnecessary. However, I submitted all codes I thought were relevant 
somehow.
Thank you for being here! You are welcome to explore this world!
